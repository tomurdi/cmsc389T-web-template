                <p>Hello!! My name is Tomas Urdinola. Both of my parents are from Colombia, so Spanish was my first language (not Java)
                    growing up. I really love listening to music so some of my favorite artists are: Marc Segui, beabadobee, and 
                    Destroy Lonely. Other cool things that I like to do are going thrifting or just buying clothes, spending time with
                    friends and family, and supporting the best soccer team in the world: F.C Barcelona.

                    <p>As we were going to transition to a cloud-based model, it meant that we had to do some database cleaning.
                        However, the databases contained forms that were of the same subject but had incorrect or missing data. Our project
                        consisted of finding the most recent form and checking to see if it incorrect or missing data. If it did,
                        we had to retrieve the correct data form and copy all of it to the currently added form. 
                    </p>

                    <h2>Simulating a Convolutional Neural Network</h2>
                    <p>AmazonNext is a new program that formed 2 years ago here at UMD. Throughout my time, we learned key business aspects
                        of Amazon, but we mainly dived into the basic principles of Machine Learning. This involved simulating a CNN which included
                        a target and a destination. However, there were obstacles that could hit the target on its way to the destination.
                        We had to optimize the time taken to get to the destination and minimize the amount of hits that the target got.

                    <h2>Form Verification</h2>
                    <p>College Success Scholars, also known as CSS, is a program that helps Black and Latino Males 
                        academically, socially, and professionally throughout their time in college. Being part of this program,
                        a group of 5, including me, volunteered to revamp our existing database. One of the projects that I was assigned
                        was to validate forms between mentors and mentees. For context, mentors are anyone on the leadership team and mentees
                        are the opposite. These mentors check up on their mentees once a week to see how their doing in school and mentally
                        as well. Both the mentee and mentor should submit some sort of Google Form saying that they met and where they met.
                        Sometimes, mentors or mentees could lie about whether they met or not or how they met. My project was to check our
                        database, scan over 200+ forms, and create some sort of mapping to the mentor's form and their mentees' form. Next,
                        I could check to see whether or not they actually met.
